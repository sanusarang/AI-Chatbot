SOLVE THE ERROR

To solve the TooManyRequests (429) error, which occurs when you exceed Twitter's API rate limit, you need to handle the rate limit properly in your code. The general approach to solving this is by adding error handling and retry logic with a delay when the rate limit is reached.

Here's how you can modify your code to handle the rate limit error:

Handle the Rate Limit Error: You'll use a try and except block to catch the TooManyRequests error.
Implement Backoff: You can use time.sleep() to pause the execution until the rate limit is reset.
Here's an updated version of your code that incorporates rate limit handling:

python
Copy
import tweepy
import pandas as pd
import time  # to handle sleep during rate limiting

# Step 1: Set up Twitter API v2 keys (replace with your credentials)
BEARER_TOKEN = "YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN_HERE"

# Step 2: Authenticate to the API using Tweepy's Client
client = tweepy.Client(bearer_token=BEARER_TOKEN)

# Step 3: Define search query and parameters
query = "Artificial Intelligence -is:retweet lang:en"  # Filter out retweets, English tweets only
max_results = 50  # Number of tweets to fetch (max 100 per request)
tweets_data = []

def fetch_tweets():
    try:
        # Step 4: Fetch tweets
        response = client.search_recent_tweets(query=query, tweet_fields=["created_at", "public_metrics", "text"], max_results=max_results)
        
        if response.data:
            for tweet in response.data:
                tweets_data.append({
                    "Tweet": tweet.text,
                    "Created At": tweet.created_at,
                    "Retweets": tweet.public_metrics["retweet_count"],
                    "Likes": tweet.public_metrics["like_count"]
                })

    except tweepy.TooManyRequests as e:
        print("Rate limit reached. Waiting for 15 minutes...")
        time.sleep(15 * 60)  # Sleep for 15 minutes before retrying
        fetch_tweets()  # Retry fetching tweets

# Step 5: Fetch tweets
fetch_tweets()

# Step 6: Save data to a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(tweets_data)

# Step 7: Export data to CSV
df.to_csv("twitter_data_v2.csv", index=False)
print("Data saved to twitter_data_v2.csv")
Key Changes:
Retry on Rate Limit: The function fetch_tweets() now handles the TooManyRequests error by sleeping for 15 minutes and then retrying the request.
time.sleep(15 * 60): This pauses execution for 15 minutes (the typical duration of the rate limit reset for the standard user access). After this wait, the function retries fetching tweets.
This should prevent your code from crashing when the rate limit is hit and automatically resume fetching once the limit is reset.

Additional Considerations:
Rate Limit for search_recent_tweets: With the free-tier Twitter API v2, the rate limit is typically 7 requests per 15-minute window. This can vary depending on the type of access you have (Elevated access, etc.). You may need to check your specific rate limits via the Twitter API documentation to adjust your backoff timing.
Exponential Backoff: For a more advanced approach, you can implement an exponential backoff strategy, where the wait time increases with each consecutive rate-limit hit.
